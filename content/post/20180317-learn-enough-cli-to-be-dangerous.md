## Ebook

Just finished reading [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).

This gives some basic introduction to the unix cli usages.
Some of the most frequently used (and might also be the most helpful ones) are:

* man
* ls
* echo (use ">" to write into files, use ">>" to append content)
* cat
* mv
* cp
* grep (pipe operator "|")
* less (vs. more)
* head and tail
* ...

<!--more-->

I remember reading somewhere that says the `man` command is a quite useful way to learn the commands in detail.
Sometimes even an example could be found in the manual descriptions.
