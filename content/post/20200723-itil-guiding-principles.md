## Summary

ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library?) 4 was published in February 2019.

>The guiding principles are one of the most useful and practical parts of ITIL 4. If you share these principles with all your people, and use them when you’re making decisions, then you’re going to do a much better job of creating value for your customers, your users, and your own organization.

## Principles

1. **Focus on Value**. Create value (financial, CX, UX, etc.) for stakeholders.
2. **Start where you are**.
3. **Progress iteratively with feedback**.
4. **Collaborate and promote visibility**. Collaborate with teams, customers, users, suppliers, and anyone else who is involved in your services.
5. **Think and work holistically**. No service, practice, process, department, or supplier stands alone.
6. **Keep it simple and practical**.
7. **Optimize and automate**. Also, always optimize the work BEFORE you automate it.
